# Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was first released in 1991. It is an interpreted language, which means that code written in Python is executed line by line, rather than compiled into an executable file. Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use, which makes it a popular choice for a wide range of applications, from web development to scientific computing.

For an overview of Python's basic asprects, follow the content @ [lecture 2](Lecture2.pdf). To test your python comprehension, follow these notebooks:

* [Python installation](Notebooks/Lab0_pythonIntro.py)
* [Numpy](Notebooks/Lab1_NumpyBasics.ipynb)
* [Matplotlib](Notebooks/Lab1_SimplePlot.ipynb) 

These are the notebooks related to the exercise of Lecture 2:

## NumPy

NumPy is a Python library for numerical computing that was first released in 2005. It provides a high-performance, multidimensional array object, as well as a set of tools for working with these arrays. NumPy is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning, among other fields, due to its efficient array operations and its ability to interface with other languages such as C and Fortran.

## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a Python library for data visualization that was first released in 2003. It provides a wide range of plot types and customization options, making it a popular choice for creating high-quality visualizations of data. Matplotlib is designed to work seamlessly with NumPy arrays, making it easy to create visualizations of data stored in NumPy arrays.

## Jupyter

Jupyter is a web-based interactive computing platform that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. The name Jupyter is a combination of three programming languages: Julia, Python, and R, which were the first languages supported by the platform.

Jupyter notebooks are the primary interface used in Jupyter, and they allow users to write and execute code in a web browser. Notebooks are organized into cells, which can contain code, Markdown text, equations, or other types of content. Users can execute individual cells or run the entire notebook, and the results of each cell are displayed directly in the notebook.

Jupyter notebooks have become a popular tool for data analysis, scientific computing, machine learning, and education. They allow users to explore data and experiment with code in an interactive and collaborative environment, making it easy to share insights and findings with others.

In addition to the standard Jupyter notebook interface, there are also several Jupyter-based tools, such as JupyterLab, which provides a more flexible and powerful environment for working with Jupyter notebooks, and JupyterHub, which allows users to run Jupyter notebooks on a shared server and collaborate with others in real time.

## Miniconda

Miniconda is a lightweight version of the Anaconda distribution, which is a popular distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and scientific computing. Unlike Anaconda, which includes many pre-installed packages and libraries, Miniconda only includes the essential packages required to get started with Python and other programming languages.

Miniconda includes two main components: the Conda package manager and Python. The Conda package manager is a powerful tool that allows users to easily install, manage, and update software packages and dependencies. It can be used to install packages from the Anaconda repository, as well as other third-party repositories and channels.

One of the main benefits of using Miniconda is that it allows users to create and manage isolated Python environments, which are self-contained environments that can be customized with specific versions of Python and packages. This makes it easy to manage dependencies and ensure that software is compatible with the specific versions of packages that are required.

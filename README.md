# SLP_NUAA

Git Repository of the Summer Lecture Program held at NUAA. This course serves as an in-depth exploration into the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques within particle and applied physics. Students will study the principles of AI, with a particular focus on machine learning methodologies. Additionally, participants will gain hands-on experience in utilizing Geant4, a powerful toolkit designed for simulating the interactions of particles with matter.

Throughout the course, these disciplines will be seamlessly merged to address advanced topics in dosimetry, specifically within the context of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). By leveraging the capabilities of AI alongside the precision of particle physics simulations, students will acquire the necessary skills to undertake dosimetry calculations with a heightened level of accuracy and efficiency.

By the culmination of this course, students will have acquired a multifaceted skill set. They will possess the ability to conceptualize, develop, and implement neural networks tailored for specific applications. Moreover, they will learn how to use simulation tools for the comprehensive evaluation of dosimetry parameters within radiobiological experimental setups.

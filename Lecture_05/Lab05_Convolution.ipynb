    "# Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution is a mathematical operation that is commonly used in deep learning for image processing tasks, such as object detection, image segmentation, and image recognition. The basic idea behind convolution is to apply a filter (also known as a kernel or a weight matrix) to an input image to obtain a transformed output image.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform convolution on an image, we start by defining a filter/kernel, which is a small matrix of numbers that represent the weights of the convolution operation. This filter is typically learned during training, but can also be manually defined. For example, a commonly used filter for edge detection is the Sobel filter (**H**).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{H} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "        -2 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n",
    "        -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we slide the filter over the image (**I**), starting at the top-left corner of the image, and apply the convolution operation at each location. This involves multiplying the values of the filter matrix with the corresponding pixel values in the image, and then summing up the products to obtain a single output value. We then move the filter to the next position and repeat the process, until we have computed the output value for every location in the image (**Y**).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{Y}_{i,j} = \\sum_{p=0}^{k} \\sum_{q=0}^{k} \\mathbf{I}_{i+p-\\frac{k-1}{2},i+q-\\frac{k-1}{2}} \\mathbf{H}_{p,q} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting output image is often transformed in some way, such as by applying a non-linear activation function like ReLU, to produce a final output that can be used for further processing or classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind convolution is that the filter detects specific patterns or features in the image, such as edges, corners, or blobs. By convolving the image with different filters, we can extract different features and information from the image, which can be used to make predictions or perform other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolution example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we load an image using the **mpimg.imread()** function from matplotlib. We convert the image to grayscale by taking the mean value of the red, green, and blue channels using **np.mean(img, axis=2)**. We then define a filter **h** (in this case, a Sobel filter) and apply the convolution operation using a nested loop that iterates over each pixel in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting plot shows the original image and the convolved image. The convolved image highlights edges and features in the image, which is often useful for tasks like image segmentation or feature detection in computer vision applications."
